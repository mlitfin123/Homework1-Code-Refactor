# Homework1-Code-Refactor

This project was done as a part of a homework project for the University of Miami Bootcamp.

A previously designed web page was created using a non-semantic HTML structure and did not always flow logically. The web page includes a single HTML and CSS file which was updated with cleaner code. The web page was given a proper title, the HTML structure was changed to fit more of a semantic structure, and many of the classes were combined to make it simpler to define and adjust them in the CSS file. Comments were then added throughout the code to make it easier for future developers to understand what was changed from the original.

The advantage of updating this web page is to make it easier for future developers to read and change the code if needed. It also can make it easier for search engines to find the web page and move it to the top of the results since it will understand the semantic structure better.

One of the challenges that I feel like can be missed a lot of times is to take into account if any elements of the web page are not working, for this reason the "alt" attribute was added for each image to describe what is meant to be taking place. Another challenge is to be detailed enough to understand when certain attributes are being unnecessarily repeated. It was easy to just say okay it works, but then upon farther investigation I noticed the sections each used the same CSS attributes and could be combined to reduce the work and possible errors if it is decided later on to change an attribute.
